# CLV-Factor-Analysis
This is a thorough analysis of factor affecting the Customer Lifetime Value in the retail sector.

Our project delves into the intricate dynamics of customer behavior and its impact on business sustainability within the retail industry. Focused on the critical metric of Customer Lifetime Value (CLV), we aim to unravel the complexities surrounding product returns and their correlation with long-term customer profitability. Leveraging a rich dataset sourced from Kaggle, our analysis spans across 24 variables and over 9,000 observations, providing a comprehensive view of customer interactions and transactions.

At the heart of our investigation lies the recognition of product returns as a ubiquitous phenomenon in retail operations, with rates averaging between 10-30%. While these returns pose significant logistical and financial challenges for retailers, they also present an opportunity to enhance customer satisfaction and loyalty through lenient return policies. Our project seeks to elucidate the intricate relationship between product returns and CLV, aiming to provide actionable insights for retailers to optimize returns management strategies while nurturing valuable customer relationships.

Employing rigorous econometric techniques, our analysis focuses on identifying the key drivers of CLV, considering factors such as demographic attributes, policy details, and customer interactions. By scrutinizing variables ranging from customer income to policy effectiveness, we endeavor to uncover patterns that shed light on the nuanced interplay between customer behavior and long-term profitability. Our findings not only contribute to the academic discourse surrounding CLV but also offer practical implications for retailers striving to navigate the complexities of modern consumer markets.

Ultimately, our project represents a convergence of theoretical inquiry and real-world application, seeking to bridge the gap between academic research and industry challenges. Through a meticulous examination of the factors influencing CLV in the context of product returns, we aim to equip retailers with actionable insights that empower them to thrive in an increasingly competitive landscape, fostering enduring relationships with their most valuable customers.
